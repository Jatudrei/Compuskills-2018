    <h2>Compuskills Debugging Lab 1</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to your first debugging lab!  In each lab, you'll get a working application along with a bug report from an imaginary end user.  You'll use a combination
        of tools to find and fix the bug that was reported.
    </p>

    <p>For each lab, you'll follow the same three step process.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Figure out <em>minimum</em> steps needed to reproduce the bug.</li>
        <li>Identify what's causing the bug.</li>
        <li>Fix the bug and verify the new code works.</li>
    </ol>
