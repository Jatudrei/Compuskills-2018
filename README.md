**Full Stack 'Web App' Developer Program**
==========================================
Welcome to the program!  Over the course of the next year, we'll take you from no prior experience to proficiency in the tools and tech of a full stack web app developer.  The program is broken up into six separate courses each focused on one aspect of web app development.  We'll finish off with a capstone project that will team you up with classmates to create a working app!  You'll create the idea, develop it, document it, design the architecture, implement, test, and deploy.  The final product will be on github for you to include as a reference in your portfolio.
