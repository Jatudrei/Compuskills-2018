**Learning Objectives**
=======================
- Disabuse yourself that it only takes an "idea" to create great software
- Explore the process every "idea" goes through before it can be used as the basis for software

**Outline**
============
- "Good software fills in a hole no one realized was empty before"
- The formal process
  1. Rough Idea (really step 0)

  2. Problem Statement - Identify what problem you intend to solve. You should consider
    - What market you intend to sell to
    - Is there any impact it will have on the market that could get in the way of your product
    - Can you make money - this involves pricing projections
      - How much can you earn; What type of income can you expect? (Ads, subscription fees, direct sales, etc)
      - How much will it cost?
      - Can you afford long term investment? - Consider Google Maps; 10 years free, now $10,000 / year / developer to use it
    - Who are the stakeholders
      - Who's going to pay for it? This is often not the end user; it might be a corporation, a government grant, donations, private investors, etc
      - Who's going to use it on a daily basis?
      - Who's going to make the decisions about the product?
    - Do "average" people have the problem; this also means they have to _understand_ they have the problem
      - Consider Febreze; It was originally developed to remove bad smells from a room
      - After release, Febreze had unexpectedly low sales
      - Their research showed people get used to the bad smells they live with and _don't think they have them_
      - Febreze rebranded to be a product that added an "extra fresh" smell to an already clean room
and it worked!

  3. Observe / Research
    - Use the 5 whys
    - Identify what people are doing today

  4. Brainstorm - UI / Background Processes
    - Expand as much as you can
    - Never throw out an idea
    - Mockups
    - Identify user experience
    - Collaboration

  5. Set Limits
    - Anticipate for organic growth
    - Identify which ideas from your brainstorm match the problem statement
    - Build a "core" prodcut

  6. Make a "Roadmap" of what your software will look like one day

  7. Make an MVP - A mimimum viable product

- _**Be curious not critical**_
  - You will encounter a lot of "stupid" business policies and practies
  - You will feel like you could do a better job running the business than the owner
  - You will be asked to implement features that you're sure will destroy the program
  - You will need to provide basic computer literacy instruction to some users
  - In all these cases (and countless others that come up), you have an opportunity to get to know the client better
  - Ask them "why do you do it that way?" or "could you tell me more about that idea, I have never heard it before..."
  - If you show genuine curiosity, it will cause a lot of goodwill between you and the client.  People love to talk about what they do.
  - Two big advantages to this: 1) you might learn something; the client might be right; 2) you won't burn bridges
