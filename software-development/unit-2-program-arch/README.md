**Program Architecture (Design)**
=================================
After you've defined _requirements_ for your program, you need to transform it into a _design / architecture for the code.  In this unit we'll learn best practices and tools to architect your program.

- Functional specs / user stories
- Identifying Behaviors / Data (CRH cards as helpers)
- Encapsulation
- SOLID design principles
- Code smells
- "Well Known" Design Patterns

For this unit, there are two great Head First books that I reccomend you read as a supplment to the lectures - "Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design" and "Head First Design Patterns".
